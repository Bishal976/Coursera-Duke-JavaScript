# Coursera-Duke-JavaScript

This repository contains the projects from the "Programming Foundations with JavaScript, HTML and CSS" course by Duke University on Coursera. Some of the interesting projects (algorithmic image, pixel manipulation) can be found in [my CodePen portfolio](http://codepen.io/hanzhu/).

The code uses a `SimpleImage` object created by Duke. Its documentation can be found [here](http://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/course1/doc/). And you can compile the code in [Duke's JavaScript environment](http://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/course1/example/index.php).
